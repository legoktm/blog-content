He did it: Patrick Marleau scored his 500th career goal. He truly is Mr. San Jose Shark.

I had the pleasure of attending the next home game on Saturday right after he reached the milestone in Vancouver, and nearly lost my voice chearing for Marleau. They mentioned his accomplishment once before the game and again during a break, and each time Marleau would only stand up and acknowledge the crowd cheering for him when he realized they would not stop until he did.

He's had his ups and downs, but he's truly a team player.

“I think when you hit a mark like this, you start thinking about everyone that’s helped you along the way,” Marleau said.

And on Saturday at home, Marleau assisted on both Sharks goals, helping out his teammates who had helped Marleau score his over the past two weeks.

Congrats Marleau, and thanks for the 20 years of hockey. Can't wait to see you raise the Cup.
