In MediaWiki 1.28, MaxSem [improved diff limits](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/285567/) in the pure PHP diff implementation that ships with MediaWiki core. However Wikimedia and other larger wikis use a PHP extension called [wikidiff2](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Wikidiff2), for better performance and additional support for Japanese, Chinese, and Thai.

wikidiff2 1.4.1 is now available in Debian unstable and will ship in stretch, and should soon be available in jessie-backports and [my PPA](https://launchpad.net/~legoktm/+archive/ubuntu/mediawiki-lts/) for Ubuntu Trusty and Xenial users. This is the first major update of the package in two years. And installation in MediaWiki 1.27+ is [now even more straightforward](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/297111/), as long as the module is installed, it will automatically be used, no global configuration required.

Additionally, releases of wikidiff2 will now be hosted and signed on [releases.wikimedia.org](https://releases.wikimedia.org/wikidiff2/).
