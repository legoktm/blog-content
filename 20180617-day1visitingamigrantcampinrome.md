As part of earning my journalism degree at San Jose State, we're required to study abroad. I'm currently on a faculty-led program (FLP) to Italy and Greece to interview migrants and refugees, conduct interviews, document their situation, and gain real world reporting experience. I will try to blog daily for the next three weeks...we'll see if it lasts!

Our trip started in Rome, Italy. Day 0 was meeting at our hotel, getting dinner together, and then enjoying some gelato. The next morning we visited the Colosseum and a few other tourist attractions before the main event for the day: visiting a camp where migrants were staying. Unfortunately, that's all I can write about for now, as I am still working on a full story to publish about our experience at the camp.

In the evening a few of us went to a rally that was protesting the murder of an immigrant, who was a union leader defending workers rights (at least, that's my understanding). There was also the issue of the anti-immigration views of the minister of internal afairs. Aside from not understanding most of what was being said since it was in Italian, I also struggled since there was no article on [Unione Sindacale di Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unione_Sindacale_di_Base) on Wikipedia. It would be great if someone could write one!
