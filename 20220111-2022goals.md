New year, [new job](https://freedom.press/people/kunal-mehta/), new goals.
In no specific order:

* Move out of my parents' house.
* Contribute something meaningful to [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/).
* Contribute something meaningful to MediaWiki.
* Not get COVID.
* Continue contributing to Mailman.
* Continue working on [mwbot-rs](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mwbot-rs),
  while having fun and learning more Rust.
* Get more stickers (lack of in-person meetups has really been hurting my
  sticker collecting).
* Port the rest of my wiki bots to Rust.
* Make progress on moving [wiki.debian.org to MediaWiki](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/grow-your-ideas/-/issues/2).
* Write at least one piece of recognized content (DYK/GA/FA) for Wikipedia.
* Travel outside the US (COVID-permitting).
* Finish in the top half of our Fantasy Football league and Pick 'em pool. I
  did pretty well in 2020 and really regressed in 2021.
* Keep track of TV show reviews/ratings. I've been pretty good about tracking
  movies I watch, but don't yet do the same for TV.

I'm hoping that 2022 will be better than the previous two years, the bar is
really, really low.
