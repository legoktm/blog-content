This is not my typical music post. Yesterday I had the pleasure of visiting the Internet Archive (more on that in a future post), and they mentioned a collection called "[Attention K-Mart Shoppers](https://archive.org/details/attentionkmartshoppers)", which is just tapes they played over and over at K-Mart. And for some reason, people enjoy listening to it!

I spent my morning today listening to it. It was really soothing and relaxing. The ads for random TV shows and store announcements were amusing, but didn't really interrupt what I was doing.

Definitely worth listening to.
