The San Jose Barracuda, the Sharks AHL affiliate team, is currently riding a 13 game winning streak, and is on top of the AHL &mdash; and that's great news for the Sharks.

Ever since the Barracuda moved here from Worcester, Mass., it's only been great news for the Sharks. Because they play in the same stadium, sending players up or down becomes as simple as a little paperwork and asking them to switch locker rooms, not cross-country flights.

This allows the Sharks to have a significantly deeper roster, since they can call up new players at a moment's notice.  So the Barracuda's win streak is great news for Sharks fans, since it demonstrates how even the minor league players are ready to play in the pros.

And if you're watching hockey, be on the watch for Joe Thornton to score his 1,000 assist! (More on that next week).
