A lot happened at the Wikimedia Developer Summit over the past week, I had a fantastic time and enjoyed getting to meet up with everyone again. Here's a quick recap:

* Learned about the status of the Differential migration, I feel more reassured about the workflow now, just not sure about when it's going to happen.
* Attended a very productive meeting with the MediaWiki Stakeholder's group, Mark (hexmode) has written up a [good summary](http://mwstake.org/mwstake/wiki/Blog_Post:37) of the meeting. I'm optimistic about the future.
* Held an impromptu session about [shadow namespaces](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Shadow_namespaces), which left me with lots of questions to answer. I haven't had a chance to summarize the notes yet, will do so later this week.
* Had an exciting main room discussion about supporting non-Wikimedia installs of MediaWiki and our other software, which continued out into the hallways. I think we need to continue with more research and talking with hosting providers about how MediaWiki is actually used. For a while now I've been concerned with whether we're able to get our users to actually upgrade. [WikiApiary says](https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/Statistics#MediaWiki_branches_usage) that 1.16.x is nearly as widely used as 1.25.x (the current legacy release).
* Had an early morning session about beta rollouts, usage of BetaFeatures, and communication channels.
* Attended the "software engineering" session about dependency injection and then SOA. I mainly just listened in this one.
* Went to a session by community liasons about interacting with communities and stuff. Also mainly just listened.
* Finally, had a really productive session led by bawolff about code review, and how we can improve the situation.

I hacked on quite a few different projects, more on that later :)
