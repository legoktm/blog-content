_Part of a [series](https://blog.legoktm.com/category/flp.html) on my journalism faculty-led program through Italy and Greece. Note: I wrote this halfway through day 17, which definitely affected what I'm writing now._

Today was mostly a stay-at-the-hotel-and-work day, so this is another reflection.

For a while now I've felt lost in where I want to go in the future. I have about a year and a little bit more of school, but after that I've been pretty unsure. I don't think I want to become a real journalist, but I've also been contemplating whether I should be continuing at my current job (in a full time capacity). At least one person I talked to on this trip suggested that other work experience outside of Wikimedia would be good for me so I can broaden my horizons and grow as a person, and I think I generally agree with him.

So the main question I've had is, what should I do? I think it's pretty clear that I want to do something that will improve the world and people's lives. I have the privledge to not have to worry that much about money, so I feel the obligation and desire to help other people.

A few people have suggested law school to me, which is pretty appealing. It seems like a lot of problems today need lawyers to fight them, and I've always had a fascination with civil rights litigation. But that requires going through law school, and I don't think I have the patience to wait that long. I want to start improving the world now.

It's funny sometimes how one small event can turn your entire life over. It was pretty dangerous, reckless, stupid, but incredibly fun. I don't think I've had my adrenaline running like that in years.

I didn't say anything to her about what happened, but my mom immediately noticed the difference in my mental state when I talked to her for 30 seconds on the phone.

We talked a lot about values, relationships, and most importantly failure last night. I don't think I've exactly found where I want to go yet, but I feel much better that I've found the right track.
