Last weekend was the NHL All-Star game and skills competition, with Brent Burns, Martin Jones, and Joe Pavelski representing the San Jose Sharks in Los Angeles. And to no one's surprise, they were all booed!

Pavelski scored a goal during the tournament for the Pacific Division, and Burns scored during the skills competition's "Four Line Challenge". But since they represented the Pacific, we have to talk about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG-pW1DRKY">impossible shot Mike Smith made</a>.

And across the country, the 2017 NFL Pro Bowl (their all-star game) was happening at the same time. The Oakland Raiders had seven Pro Bowlers (tied for most from any team), and the San Francisco 49ers had...none.

In the meantime the 49ers managed to hire a former safety with no General Manager-related experience as their new GM. It's really not clear what Jed York, the 49ers owner, is trying out here, and why he would sign John Lynch to a six year contract.

But really, how much worse could it get for the 49ers?
