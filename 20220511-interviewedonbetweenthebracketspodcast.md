I was recently interviewed on Between the Brackets: A MediaWiki podcast: [Episode 112 - Kunal Mehta](https://betweenthebrackets.libsyn.com/episode-112-kunal-mehta). I'm the first ever repeat guest, my first appearance was in 2018 in [Episode 9](https://betweenthebrackets.libsyn.com/episode-9-kunal-mehta). You can listen through the web interface or in your favorite podcast client.

Thanks to [Yaron Koren](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Yaron_Koren) for having me on.
