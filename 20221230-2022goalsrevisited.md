I [set some goals](https://blog.legoktm.com/2022/01/11/2022-goals.html) for myself at the beginning of the year. 

Here's how it went:

* Move out of my parents' house.<br>✔️  I live in New York City now. This was definitely my biggest goal and accomplishment of the year.
* Contribute something meaningful to [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/).<br>✔️  I think so. I need to writeup some of the stuff I worked on in the past year.
* Contribute something meaningful to MediaWiki.<br>✔️  Slightly more mixed because I contributed a lot less this year than in the past, but I still consider myself having contributed in a meaningful way.
* Not get COVID.<br>❌ Got it in June :(
* Continue contributing to Mailman.<br>❌ Didn't really find the motivation this year. I'm hoping to spend more time on this in 2023, Wikimedia's Mailman install is showing that it needs more love.
* Continue working on [mwbot-rs](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mwbot-rs),
  while having fun and learning more Rust.<br>✔️  I posted updates on the [News](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mwbot-rs/News) page.
* Get more stickers (lack of in-person meetups has really been hurting my
  sticker collecting).<br>✔️  Definitely. New stickers include FIRE, California poppies, Pacific Northwest, Qubes, HOPE 2022, Pinnacles National Park, a corgi, and very nice yellow and blue bird that says, "There is more power in peace than in violence".
* Port the rest of my wiki bots to Rust.<br>❌ Still running in good old PHP. I don't really think this is worth it anymore, people are too used to the current bugs that introducing a different set of bugs would be more disruptive than helpful.
* Make progress on moving [wiki.debian.org to MediaWiki](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/grow-your-ideas/-/issues/2).<br>❌ No real progress :(
* Write at least one piece of recognized content (DYK/GA/FA) for Wikipedia.<br>✔️  I racked up 4 DYKs this year, [List of United States Supreme Court leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_leaks) (May 2022), [Eleanor Bellows Pillsbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Bellows_Pillsbury) (June 2022), [2022 University of California academic workers' strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_University_of_California_academic_workers%27_strike) (Dec. 2022), and [Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Coalition_for_Firearm_Rights) (Dec. 2022). Hitting the DYK threshold feels pretty straightforward now that I should probably aim for a GA!
* Travel outside the US (COVID-permitting).<br>❌ I probably had the opportunity, but just didn't feel comfortable because of COVID. Planning at least two international trips in 2023!
* Finish in the top half of our Fantasy Football league and Pick 'em pool. I
  did pretty well in 2020 and really regressed in 2021.<br>❓ Too early to say. Currently doing well in the Pick 'em pool, but not in Fantasy.
* Keep track of TV show reviews/ratings. I've been pretty good about tracking
  movies I watch, but don't yet do the same for TV.<br>❌ Started, but didn't finish.

Publicly publishing a list of goals was nice, every few months I'd re-read the post to see if I was on track or not. But I don't intend to publish my 2023 goals, I expect they'll be more personal than these were.
