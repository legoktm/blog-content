Pelican theming isn't actually that difficult. It's based on jinja2 templates, and there were enough themes already out there to pick one and just start forking it.

I'm not too happy that they want themes installed into your system python path (or a virtualenv in my case), but since you can symlink them, it's not too bad.

I found one I liked called [pelican-sober](https://github.com/fle/pelican-sober), which I ended up [forking](https://github.com/legoktm/pelican-sober/tree/changes) to customize some parts of it.
