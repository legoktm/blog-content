Title: Working the polls: reflection

As I said earlier, I worked the polls from 6 a.m. to roughly 9:20 p.m. We had one voter come in at the nick of time at 7:59 p.m.

I was glad to see that we had a lot of first time voters, as well as some who just filled out one issue on the three(!) page ballot, and then left. Overall, I've come to the conclusion that everyone is just like me and votes just to get a sticker. We had quite a few people who voted by mail and stopped by just to get their "I voted!" sticker.

I should get paid $145 for working, which I shall be donating to <https://riseup.net/>. And I plan to be helping out during the next election!
