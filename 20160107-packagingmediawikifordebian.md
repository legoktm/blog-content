Title: Packaging MediaWiki for Debian

Over the past few months I've been working on an updated Debian package for MediaWiki. After working with Luke, Faidon, Moritz, and a few others, we now have a mostly working package! It's being developed in Gerrit (the [mediawiki/debian](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/q/project:mediawiki/debian,n,z) repository), so it hopefully will get more visibility, and we can keep it in sync with current development.

If you're interested in testing, I've uploaded it to [people.wikimedia.org](https://people.wikimedia.org/~legoktm/debian/) for now.
