After being generally frustrated by this election cycle and wanting to contribute to make it less so, I decided to sign up to work at the polls this year, and help facilitate the election. Yesterday, we had election officer training by the Santa Clara County Registrar of Voter's office. It was pretty fascinating to me given that I've only ever voted by mail, and haven't been inside a physical polling place in years. But the biggest takeaway I had, was that California goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure that everyone can vote. There's basically no situation in which someone who claims they are eligible to vote is denied being able to vote. Sure, they end up voting provisionally, but I think that is significantly better than turning them away and telling them they can't vote.
