While we're waiting for the results ([September 21st at the earliest](https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/message/NWTI3KACOSKDFG4V72GHIPINYKV2AU6L/)),
I want to thank everyone who helped with my [WMF Board candidacy](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2022/Candidates/Kunal_Mehta).

From the people who initially gave me the confidence to run,
to the people who helped me get through the Affiliate round,
and then the people who ran Get Out The Vote efforts for the community voting period or even just told me that they were supporting me: thank you.

A very special set of people were there every stage of the way, I can't
really express in words how much I appreciate each of you. <3

Globally, voter turnout was down: only 5,955 votes this year compared to last
year's 6,873. Yet, in each group of users we tracked, turnout was solidly up:

Pretty incredible. Now it's at least two more weeks of anxious waiting and hopefully
some time for actual wiki editing!
