As I posted about earlier, the election for the WMF Board of Trustees is
wrapping up. Today is the final day for voting, it closes at
23:59 September 6 UTC ([in your local timezone](https://zonestamp.toolforge.org/1662508827)).

You should:

* [Read about the candidates](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2022/Candidates)
* [Vote!](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:SecurePoll/vote/393)
* Tell other people to vote!

Thank you to everyone who has already voted and is encouraging other Wikimedians to vote. This is an incredibly important election and every vote counts.
