Title: Why am I still here?

Honestly, I'm not sure. I'm not working at the WMF for the money. And it's not because my job is fun - it stopped being fun a few months ago. I'm mostly still here because I don't really have anything else to do right now. I've been doing this for nearly 3 years now...and even though I have other plans lined up in a few months, I'm kind of a lame duck right now.

I'm embarrassed at everything that's gone on. I don't want to tell my friends that the WMF is all screwed up and not going to get better. I don't want to have to explain how after I praised how all of my work is public and transparent, that our organization no longer is.

The whole Arnnon situation never really sank in for me. It was mostly surreal, with me thinking that there was no way they'd actually let him stay on the board. All the right people spoke up, signed the petition, and then he was removed. The process worked! Not at all. The excuse of not knowing about it because they didn't use "google.com" is ludicrous, that I don't even know what to say about it.

It greatly frustrates me, and upsets me that my friends are in danger of having to leave the country if they lose their jobs, and can't speak up because of that fear. 

Honestly, I don't understand why the current leadership hasn't left yet. Why would you want to work at a place where 93% of your employees don't believe you're doing a good job, and others have called you a liar (with proof to back it up) to your face, in front of the entire staff? I don't know everything that's going on right now, but we're sick right now and desparately need to move on.

I love, and will always love Wikimedia, but I can't say the same about the current state of the Wikimedia Foundation. I've been around for nearly nine years now (nearly half my life), and it feels like that world is slowly crumbling away and I'm powerless to stop it.

And that's all my incoherent rambling for tonight.


And now for something less depressing and totally awesome, I mostly-finished the first version of the WikimediaPageViewInfo extension, you can see a demo at <http://bf-wmpageview.wmflabs.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift?action=info>. It's currently going through a security review, and myself and Addshore are going to work on getting it deployed!
