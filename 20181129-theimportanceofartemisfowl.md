Nearly two decades later, the [Artemis Fowl movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXlBep9uFjI) is finally happening. It's hard for me to overstate how important Artemis Fowl has been to me. One of my friends asked me if I saw the trailer today and I pretty ecstatically said yes. [Artemis Fowl Confidential](https://www.artemis-fowl.com/), a website I registered with back in 2008, sent me an email as soon as it was released. Immediate nostalgia.

I read the original [Artemis Fowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_Fowl_(novel)) sometime in elementary school, by the time the final book, [Artemis Fowl: The Last Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_Fowl:_The_Last_Guardian), was released, I had already graduated high school.

Sometime in eighth grade I joined the Wikipedia [WikiProject Artemis Fowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Artemis_Fowl) - a group of editors dedicated to improve Wikipedia's coverage of Artemis Fowl related articles. I went through the archives and even found the [original post, welcoming me to the project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Artemis_Fowl/Archive#Election). Those were my first friends on Wikipedia...Calvin, Icy, Laptopdude. Miss y'all.

And at some point I learned templates, creating [Template:AF Cite Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AF_Cite_Book). Then that turned into the [first ever bug](https://static-bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14550) I would file in Wikimedia Bugzilla (I still have bug 2700 memorized for some reason).

And then that Wikipedia thing spiraled out of control, and somehow I ended up with an actual, real, job. Definitely due to other things, but just a little bit thanks to Artemis Fowl.

Thanks [Eoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eoin_Colfer), and here's to the next twenty years of Artemis Fowl!
