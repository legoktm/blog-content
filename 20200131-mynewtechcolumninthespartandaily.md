After a pretty hectic last semester, I'm taking a much more backseat role on the Spartan Daily for hopefully my final semester at San Jose State. I'm going to be the new "Science & Tech Editor" - yes, I invented my own position. I am currently planning for a science & tech section every month as a special feature.

Every two weeks though, I'm going to be publishing a column, titled "Binary Bombshells", about the different values imbued in technology, analyzing the values they contain, explaining what effects they have upon us and suggesting any avenues for improvement.

You can read the first installment of my column now: [Values exist in all technologies](https://sjsunews.com/article/binary-bombshells-values-exist-in-all-technologies).
