And so it has been found. Tom Brady's jersey was in Mexico the whole time, stolen by a member of the press. And while it's great news for Brady, sports memorabilia fans, and the FBI, it doesn't look good for journalists. Journalists are given a lot of access to players, allowing them to obtain better content and get better interviews. It would not be surprising if the NFL responds to this incident by locking down the access that journalists are given. And that would be real bummer.

I'm hoping this is seen as an isolated incident and all journalists are not punished for the offenses by one.
