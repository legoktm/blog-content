In California March Madness is really...March Sadness. The only Californian team that is still in is UCLA. UC Davis made it in but was quickly eliminated. USC and Saint Mary's both fell in the second round. Cal and Stanford didn't even make it in. At best we can root for Gonzaga, but that's barely it.

Some of us root for school's we went to, but for those of us who grew up here and support local teams, we're left hanging. And it's not bias in the selection commitee, those schools just aren't good enough.

On top of that we have a top notch professional team through the Warriors, but our amateur players just aren't up to muster.

So good luck to UCLA, represent California hella well. We somewhat believe in you.
