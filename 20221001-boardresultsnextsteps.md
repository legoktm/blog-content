Unfortunately, I didn't make it onto the Wikimedia Foundation board, you
can see the [full results](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2022/Results/Community_voting).
In the first round I was behind by ~280 votes, which is pretty close
considering nearly 6,000 votes were cast!

I already said it, but I'm really thankful to everyone who supported me,
whether you campaigned for me or just cast a vote. If there's anything
I can do to help you out, you know how to find me :-)

What's next? First, it's [time for me to get back to work](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/833812), I only have a 4-month backlog of bugs and patches to get through. And then continuing to [agitate for change](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/should_you_agitate_innovate_or_orchestrate) to make the WMF and Wikimedia a better place.

P.S. I'm also planning to be [much more involved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/Election_2022#Legoktm) with the awesome people in Wikimedia New York City in the coming year.
