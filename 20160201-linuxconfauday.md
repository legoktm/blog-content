Today was day 1 of the linux.conf.au conference in Geelong. The first two days are organized as "MiniConfs", where rooms have a general topic and presentations are scheduled by the MiniConf organizer instead of the LCA programme committee. In the morning I primarily attended the documentation/technical writing MiniConf. I was slightly surprised by how many of the presenters were from Red Hat, but I'm not surprised that they write a lot of documentation. In the morning, I liked the "[On working from home](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/30321/view_talk?day=monday)" talk, and some of the tips that different remotees shared. I particularly enjoyed the one where someone set a 3 hour expiry on their ssh keyring so they would be reminded to eat lunch while trying to log into a server.

In the afternoon I attended "[Assorted Security Topics in Open Cloud: Overview of Advanced Threats, 2015â€™s Significant Vulnerabilities and Lessons, and Advancements in OpenStack Trusted Computing and Hadoop Encryption](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/30298/view_talk?day=monday)", and I have to say that I didn't really follow most of the talk; I don't think I was the right audience for it. After that I went back to the documentation MiniConf and listened to the amusing "[My beautiful jacket](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/30324/view_talk?day=monday)" talk.

After afternoon tea (a totally awesome concept by the way), I went over to the bio MiniConf for "[Building and deploying the Genomics Virtual Laboratory on the cloud(s)](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/30309/view_talk?day=monday)", not really sure what to expect. It turned out to be a pretty good technical talk, and some of the technology they had built looked really interesting, including their [cloudbridge](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge) library. And we finished with one of the best named talks, "[Sequencing your poo with a USB stick](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/30310/view_talk?day=monday)". As someone who doesn't really enjoy biology or understand most of it aside from what I learned in high school, I thourougly enjoyed this presentation. The presenter explained most of the concepts, and was an extremely engaging speaker.

The [Ingress BoF](https://linux.conf.au/wiki/Ingress_BoF) was in the evening, so it was nice getting to meet some other players and have dinner with them, even if there wasn't much Ingressing. ;)

Ready for day 2!
