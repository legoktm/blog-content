The 2018 spring semester started last Wednesday. I think I've set up a pretty good free software toolkit for a successful year:

* Operating system: [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) - latest software with stable releases
* Browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - what else? :-) Note that our school and most California universities and colleges have adopted the AGPL licensed [Canvas learning management system](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms), so usually my browser is running free JavaScript code too!
* Documents/notes: [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - nearly all professors are fine with assignments being submitted as plain text or PDF, only a few want docx specifically. For professors that insist you need to use Times New Roman or fail the assignment - not a single one has noticed my usage of Liberation Serif.
* Cloud storage: [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) - I self-host a nextcloud instance that all my school documents are saved to. Additionally I have the Android app on my phone for convenient reading of notes while I'm on the train.
* Photos: [Shotwell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell/) - very simple photo organizer, though I would also like to become more proficient at [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) soon.
* Email: [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) - I have filters set up so all my school email gets filtered into a folder that I normally read first.

Total software cost: $0
