I've decided to go back to school starting in April for the spring quarter. I'm tenatively going to be studying journalism, because that seems interesting to me right now. We'll see how long that lasts. ;-)

At the same time I'm also going to be switching to a part-time contract with the Wikimedia Foundation, transferring to the Parsing team, and working on the implementation of [shadow namespaces](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Shadow_namespaces).

So...yay change! But that's enough change for now.
