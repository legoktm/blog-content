_Part of a [series](https://blog.legoktm.com/category/flp.html) on my journalism faculty-led program through Italy and Greece._

It's over. Tonight was our last night on the trip, and we head back to Athens tomorrow. I think I learned a lot more about myself than the skills and knowledge I picked up. I spent some time reflecting by talking to people in person, so I'm not going to write anything up tonight. Goodbye (for now!) ^.^

P.S.: My team won in *Jeopardy!* tonight, $2,600 - $500 - $400 - $200. It was fun.
