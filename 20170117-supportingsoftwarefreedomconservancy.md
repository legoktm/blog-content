[Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) is a pretty awesome non-profit that does some great stuff. They currently have a [fundraising match](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2016/nov/29/private-internet-access-2016-fundraising-match/) going on, that was recently extended for another week. If you're able to, I think it's worthwhile to support their organization and mission. I just renewed my membership.
