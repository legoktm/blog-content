Last week I officially joined the [Site Reliability Engineering team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Site_Reliability_Engineering) at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/). I'll be working with the Service Operations team, which "...takes care of public and “user-visible” services."

I'm glad to be back at the WMF; I had originally started working there in 2013 but recently took a break to [finish school](https://blog.legoktm.com/2020/11/24/legoktm-bs.html). SRE will be my ninth distinct team at the WMF, and I'm looking forward to even more adventures.

As part of transitioning into my new role, I have unsubscribed myself from most MediaWiki bug mail and Gerrit notifications. Once I get more situated I'll put out a more detailed request for new maintainers for the components that need them. I'll continue taking care of maintenance as needed until then.

P.S.: I created a [new userbox about Rust](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Template:User_Rust) on mediawiki.org.
