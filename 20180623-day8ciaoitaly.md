_Part of a [series](https://blog.legoktm.com/category/flp.html) on my journalism
 faculty-led program through Italy and Greece._

Today was effectively our last day in Italy. Tomorrow we're flying to Athens, and will spend the rest of our time in Greece.

We went to see the [Valley of the Temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valle_dei_Templi), which, surprise surprise, is not actually a valley! It's on a mountain ridge, which actually makes for better views and sights than if it were in a valley.

My favorite part was probably the statue of Icarus. Yes, I know it's a modern creation, but it's still incredibly cool. And the juxtaposition of the Template of Concordia behind it was fantastic.

I have more things I need to write, but I need a bit more time to collect my thoughts, and it's already late. So hopefully I'll write them tomorrow (from Greece!). Ciao Italy!
