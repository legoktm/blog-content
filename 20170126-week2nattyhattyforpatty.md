The only person who would dare upstage Patrick Marleau's four goal night is Randy Hahn, with his hilarious call after Marleau's third goal to finish a natural hat-trick: "NATTY HATTY FOR PATTY". And after scoring another, Marleau became the first player to score four goals in a single period since the great Mario Lemieux did in 1997. He's also the third Shark to score four goals in a game, joining Owen Nolan (no video available, but his [hat-trick from the 1997 All-Star game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlzvqoy99vU) is fabulous) and [Tomáš Hertl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRtXBt2hyjw).

Marleau is also ready to hit his next milestone of 500 career goals - he's at 498 right now. Every impressive stat he puts up just further solidifies him as one of the greatest hockey players of his generation. But he's still missing the one achievement that all the greats need - a Stanley Cup. The Sharks made their first trip to the Stanley Cup Finals last year, but realistically had very little chance of winning; they simply were not the better team.

The main question these days is how long Marleau and Joe Thornton will keep playing for, and if they can stay healthy until they eventually win that Stanley Cup.
