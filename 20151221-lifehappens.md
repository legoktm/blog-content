It's been a while since I last blogged, so here's a quick summary of what's been going on (totally out of order):

* Joined the [Let's Encrypt beta](https://letsencrypt.org/), all of legoktm.com is now HTTPS-only. Same with the [Wikimedia DC farm](https://wikimediadc.org/wiki/Home). Uncyclomedia is currently transitioning.
* Reached [level 8](/2015/11/26/ingress-level-8.html) as an Ingress agent.
* Had my second [spontaneous pneumothorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax) in the right lung :-(.
* Helping out with building [PAWS](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/PAWS).
* Mentoring high schoolers as part of [GCI](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Code-in_2015). Somehow I ended up mentoring tasks with both Wikimedia and MusicBrainz.
* Worked with Addshore so [Special:ExtensionDistributor](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor) now shows the top 15 downloaded extensions ([details](https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-December/084296.html)).
* More cross-wiki Echo notifications work, and other random Echo cleanup.
* Helped out with the [MediaWiki 1.26 release](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/12/14/new-mediawiki-release/).
* I started running a [tor relay](https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/7B190463E733CC292AA4010D194D1798CD8EB9A0).
* [Cleaned up](https://github.com/Toollabs/daily-image-l/pull/3) the daily-image-l code.
* [Presented](http://604robotics.com/resources/awards/) at the WRRF workshops about FRC Awards, and how they're easier to win than regionals.

Also, new laptop stickers ^.^
