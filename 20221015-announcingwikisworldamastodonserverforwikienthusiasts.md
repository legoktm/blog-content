Recently mastodon.technology announced it was [shutting down at the end of the year](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/). It's been a great home for my postings and a bunch of people I follow.
My mastodon.technology handle was even printed in my college newspaper (normally reporters' Twitter handles were used).

To fill the gap, [Taavi](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Taavi) and I have launched [wikis.world](https://wikis.world/), a Mastodon server for wiki enthusiasts. Please reach out to one of us for an invite!

You can follow me as [`@legoktm@wikis.world`](https://wikis.world/@legoktm).

Originally our plan was to self-host Mastodon and recruit a team of volunteers to share sysadmin duties, but we didn't get enough volunteers (pretty understandable!). [Nemo](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Nemo_bis)
suggested using a hosting service like [masto.host](https://masto.host/), which is exactly what we ended up doing. Once we had the domain name, it was pretty straightforward to get set up and start customizing.

Our plan is to apply for a ["Rapid" grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Rapid) to cover the cost of the domain name and hosting.

Looking forward I'm expecting another influx of people joining the Fediverse as Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter continues. Hopefully Wikis World can be a good starting point for all of our friends who are involved in
wikis and need a place to start!
