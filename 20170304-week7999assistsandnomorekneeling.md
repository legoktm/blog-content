Joe Thornton is one assist away from reaching 1,000 in his career. He's a team player - the recognition of scoring a goal doesn't matter to him, he just wants his teammates to score. And his teammates want him to achieve this milestone too, as shown by Sharks passing to Thornton and him passing back instead of them going directly for the easy empty netter.

Oh, and now that the trade deadline has passed with no movement on the goalie front, it's time for In Jones We Trust:

In other news, Colin Kaepernick announced that he's going to be a free agent and opted out of the final year of his contract. But in even bigger news, he said he will stop kneeling for the national anthem. I don't know if he is doing that to make himself more marketable, but I wish he would have stood (pun intended) with his beliefs.
