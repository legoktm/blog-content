Packages for the MediaWiki 1.31 LTS release are now available for the new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS "Focal Fossa" release in my [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~legoktm/+archive/ubuntu/mediawiki-lts). Please let me know if you run into any errors or issues.

In the future these packages will be upgraded to the MediaWiki 1.35 LTS release, whenever that's ready. It's currently [delayed because of the pandemic](https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2020-March/000249.html), but I expect that it'll be ready for the next Debian release.
