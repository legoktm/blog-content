As you might have guessed due to the lack of previous coverage of the Warriors, I'm not really a basketball fan. But the Warriors are in an interesting place right now. After setting an NBA record for being the fastest team to clinch a playoff spot, Coach Kerr has started resting his starters and the Warriors have a three game losing streak. This puts the Warriors in danger of losing their first seed spot with the San Antonio Spurs only half a game behind them. 

But I think the Warriors are doing the right thing. Last year the Warriors set the record for having the best regular season record in NBA history, but also became the first team in NBA history to have a 3-1 advantage in the finals and then lose.

No doubt there was immense pressure on the Warriors last year. It was just expected of them to win the championship, there really wasn't anything else.


So this year they can easily avoid a lot of that pressure by not being the best team in the NBA on paper. They shouldn't worry about being the top seed, just seed in the top four, and play your best in the playoffs. Get some rest, they have a huge advantage over every other team simply by already being in the playoffs with so many games left to play.
