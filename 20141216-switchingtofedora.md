I recently got a new ThinkPad T440S through work, and decided to install Fedora on it. This was a few weeks ago, so I started out with Fedora 20 (now running F21). 

Overall, it's perfect. There are a few issues so far, but all of those seem to be hardware related. Mainly:

* wifi randomly drops causing the entire OS to freeze
* touchpad gets annoying while typing (I ended up disabling it)

Other than that, I absolutely love it. I'm always amazed at how fast the boot is compared to my MacBook, the SSD was totally worth it.
