<center>[Skip Mobile Wikipedia](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-mobile-wikipedia/) on Firefox Add-ons</center>

Lately, I've been reading Wikipedia on my phone significantly more than I used to. I get 15 minutes on the train each morning, which makes for some great reading time. But when I'm on my phone, Wikipedia redirects to the mobile website. I'm sure there are some people out there who love it, but it's not for me.

There's a "Desktop" button at the bottom of the page, but it's annoying and inconvenient. So I created my first Firefox Add-on, "Skip Mobile Wikipedia". It rewrites all requests to the mobile Wikipedia website to the standard canonical domain, and sets a cookie to prevent any further redirects. It works on the standard desktop Firefox and on Android.

[Install the Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-mobile-wikipedia/) and [view the source code](https://git.legoktm.com/legoktm/skip-mobile-wikipedia).
