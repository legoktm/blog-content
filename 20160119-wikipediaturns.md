Wikipedia turned 15 last week. Aside from having my friends wish *me* a happy birthday, I also went to the party in [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/San_Francisco/Wikipedia_Day_2016). I had a good time meeting up with some Wikimedians that I hadn't seen in a while, and also enjoyed the talks. My favorite was by [User:Dreamyshade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dreamyshade), who talked about "[Stories from the weird old days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLmGc-hpp3U)". I'd recommend watching it if you have 30 minutes of free time :-)

And as always, new [laptop sticker](https://twitter.com/legoktm/status/689365486765637634) ^.^
